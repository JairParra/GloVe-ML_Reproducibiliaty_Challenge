A convolutional neural network library for NLP.

This library is not actively maintained. YMMV.

Installation
------------

Requires [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

Run `./setup_environment.sh` to install a virtualenv with the dependnecies.  If you have a gpu run `./setup_environment --cuda` instead.

Run scripts in `code/` and its subdirectories with `./run.sh script.py args go here`.

You need fftw installed before running `setup_environment.sh`, eg `sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc`.

This code was used for the experiments in
